## Overview of bikesharing with Tableau:

[NYC Citi Bike-Sharing Analysis Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mihai.anghel/viz/NYCCitiBikeAnalysis_16409608570130/NYCCitiBikeAnalysis?publish=yes) 

### Purpose
___
The purpose of this analysis is to create a proposal to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.

To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. 

Visuzliations for the following will be created using a converted datatype from the Module:

* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

  
### bikesharing Results

### bikesharing Summary
___

The data suggests that the majority of users may be work commuters, rather than tourists as the peak times for both males and females seem to be around the regular morning/evening commute times for work in Manhattan.

Although the majority of users are male, there are a significant number of unknown users, which should be taken into account as this variance can help balance the difference between the two groups a little. 

Knowing that the majority of the subscribers/users are male can be an important factor for marketing/advertisting purposes in Des Moines.

Suggestions:
* Including age in the data set, to understand the distintion in male vs. female riders as they age. This could be used to further determine the usefulness of the servie for individuals who use bike-sharing as a commuting option to work.
* Start/End locations during morning and afternoon peak hours, to visualize flow of traffic during these hours. This could help the company better understand optimal locations for their bike centers, and maybe add/remove some for the sake of saving money and investing it elsewhere in the business.
